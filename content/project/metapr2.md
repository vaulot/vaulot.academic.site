This is a new project which aims at making publicly available a database of curated metabarcodes processed with [dada2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html) and for which taxonomy is assigned with [PR2](https://github.com/pr2database/pr2database). If you are interested please contact me.  The currently processed database includes:
* OSD 2014 V4 LGC
* OSD 2014 V4 LW
* OSD 2015 V4
* Arctic - Beaufort Sea - MALINA cruise - Monier 2014
* Baltic Sea 2012-2013
* Oslo fjord 2009-2011
