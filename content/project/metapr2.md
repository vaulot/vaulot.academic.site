This project aims at making publicly available a database of curated metabarcodes processed with [dada2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html) and for which taxonomy is assigned with [PR2](https://github.com/pr2database/pr2database).

We have developed an interactive web site which allows to visualize, analyze and download the processed data.  This includes treemaps of taxonomy, barplots as a function of environmental variables, abundance maps as well as alpha and beta diversity analyses.

The first version of the database (1.1) has been released in Spring 2022 (https://shiny.metapr2.org).

THe paper presenting the database is now published.
