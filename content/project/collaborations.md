## 2017-2019 - Catalyst (New Zealand)

### Partners
* New Zealand -  NIWA (Andres Gutierrez, Linn Hoffmann, and Moira Decima)
* France - Station Biologique de Roscoff (Fabrice Not, Ian Probert, Daniel Vaulot, Adriana Lopes dos Santos)

### Objectives
The objective of this research is to develop and implement the use of high-throughput sequencing techniques to assess the diversity and community structure of planktonic systems. This objective will be achieved merging the French team world class expertise in high-throughput sequencing and genomic approaches with the NZ teams chemical and biological oceanographic expertise and field-sampling capacities.
In addition to filling a fundamental knowledge gap, joint-field research project will provide a reference baseline against which detect/evaluate changes in the pelagic ecosystem structure and function in response to environmental changes associated to human-derived activities (e.g. climate change, ocean acidification).

### Cruises
* Campbell Plateau - May 2017
* Ross Sea - Feb 2018
* Salp - Oct - Nov 2018

## 2017-2019 - MicrAntar (ECOS-Chili)
**Inter-annual variation of Microbial Eukaryotic Communities in Antarctica**

### Partners
* Chili -  Universidad Mayor (Nicole Trefault) / Ponttifical Universidad de Chile (Rodrigo de la Iglesia)
* France - Station Biologique de Roscoff (Daniel Vaulot, Adriana Lopes dos Santos)

### Objectives
Size-fractionated samples of microbial eukaryotes collected at a fixed station at Fildes Bay, King George Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula, will be analyzed in terms of taxonomic diversity. Diversity of microbial eukaryotes will be accessed during five consecutive summers, in order to analyze the central patterns of summer inter-annual variation in microbial eukaryote communities, and the differences between size fractions. The integrated use of high throughput amplicon sequencing, multivariate statistical analysis and network analysis will allow us to link the taxonomic information with the environmental information and determine the amount of variability explained by environmental variables measured. 

## 2015-2018 - PicoBras (COFECUB, CAPES France- Brasil)
