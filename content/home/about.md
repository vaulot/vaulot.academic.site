After attending the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, the Ecole Nationale du Génie Rural and working as an engineer for a few years, I did a PhD on the cell cycle regulation of phytoplankton with[ Penny Chisholm](https://www.crafoordprize.se/press_release/the-crafoord-prize-in-biosciences-2019) at MIT, Cambridge, US.  Since 1985, I have a researcher at CNRS, working at the [Station Biologique of Roscoff](http://www.sb-roscoff.fr/en) (France). I initially developed applications of flow cytometry to measure picoplankton abundance in the Ocean.  I then focused on the diversity and ecology of eukaryotic picophytoplankton developing molecular approaches such as gene cloning, metabarcoding and metagenomics.  Currently my interests revolve around green algae, bolidophytes and haptophytes involved in symbioses with cyanobacteria.  I have also a keen interest in data processing and data analysis of metabarcoding using especially R. I created in 1998 the [Roscoff Culture Collection](http://www.roscoff-culture-collection.org/), which is now the biggest collection in the world for marine phytoplankton. I am currently spending one year at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore as a visiting Professor.
