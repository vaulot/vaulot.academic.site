I did my PhD with Penny Chisholm at MIT working on the cell cycle regulation of phytoplankton.  Since 1985, I have been working at the Station Biologique of Roscoff since 1985. I am focusing on the diversity and ecology of eukaryotic picophytoplankton, more specifically the green algae, but also of other groups like bolidophytes and haptophytes involved in symbioses with cyanobacteria.  I am also the scientific director of the Roscoff Culture Collection.

## Major current research projects
* Diversity and oceanic distribution of marine green algae, with a focus on oceanic prasinophytes from clade VII
* Diversity and distribution of Bolidophytes and Parmales (collaboration with A. Kuwata, Japan)
* Analysis of eukaryotic communities using metabarcoding of the 18S rRNA gene, especially on populations sorted by flow cytometry (cooperation with USP, São Paulo, Brazil)
* Polar picoplankton communities (projects GreenEdge, TaxMArc and MicroPolar, cooperation with Chile) and their adapatation to the long winter polar night (ANR PhytoPol)

## Current postdocs
* Margot Tragin, Post-doc. Genetic transformation of  eukaryotic picoplankton (Moore Foundation)
* Catherine Ribeiro-Gerikas, Post-doc. Bloom dynamics at the ice edge in the Arctic : culturing and metabarcoding approaches (ANR Green Edge + CG 29)
* Valeria Jimenez, Post-doc. Survival of phytoplankton during the polar winter (ANR PhytoPol + Region Bretagne)

## Collaborations
* Akira Kuwata, Sendai, Japan
* Bente Edvardsen and Wenche Eikrem, Oslo, Norway
* Rodrigo de la Iglesia and Nicole Trefaut, Santiago, Chile
* Marcel Babin, Takuvik, Québec
* Hervé Moreau, Banyuls, France
