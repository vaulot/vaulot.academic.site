## Major research topics
* Diversity and oceanic distribution of marine phytoplankton, in particular green algae and Bolidophyceae.
* Analysis of marine eukaryotic communities using metabarcoding of the 18S rRNA gene, especially on populations sorted by flow cytometry.
* Polar picoplankton communities and their adapatation to the long winter polar night.
* Maintenance of the PR2 database of 18S rRNA sequences
