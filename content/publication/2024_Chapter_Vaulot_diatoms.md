abstract = "In this chapter, we provide information on cultures of diatoms, starting with a brief introduction of the history of diatom culture collections. We present a synopsis of diatom strains currently available in culture collections and their representation in terms of habitat diversity, geographical distribution, phylogeny and taxonomic diversity. We outline the major techniques for isolating and cultivating diatoms and discuss the problems and possible strategies linked to diatom life cycles and habitat requirements. We summarize information and techniques available for long-term preservation of diatom cultures. Finally, we also describe the main strategies to make diatom strains amenable to genetic engineering."
