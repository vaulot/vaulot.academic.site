abstract = "In the Arctic Ocean, the small green alga *Micromonas polaris* dominates pico-phytoplankton during the summer months. It has been previously hypothesized to be phago-mixotrophic (capable of bacteria ingestion) based on laboratory and field experiments. Prey uptake was analysed in several *M. polaris* strains isolated from different regions and depths of the Arctic Ocean. Using both fluorescent beads and fluorescently labelled bacteria as prey, we found no evidence of phago-mixotrophy in any *M. polaris* strain by flow cytometric measurement of prey ingestion. In addition, *in silico* predictions reveal that members of the genus *Micromonas* lack a genetic signature of phagocytotic capacity."
