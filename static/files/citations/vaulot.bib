A rapid increase in biomass and cell abundance occurred in response to a vertical mixing event. This increase also resulted in a shift in composition from diatoms to Prymnesiophyceae, and then back to diatoms as the water column re-stratified.

We therefore hypothesize that current diversity surveys have only skimmed the surface of protist diversity in marine sediments, which may harbour greater diversity than planktonic environments. We tested this by analyzing sequences of the hypervariable V4 18S rRNA from benthic and planktonic protist communities sampled in European coastal regions. Despite a similar number of OTUs in both realms, richness estimations indicated that we recovered at least 70% of the diversity in planktonic protist communities, but only 33% in benthic communities. There was also little overlap of OTUs between planktonic and benthic communities, as well as between separate benthic communities. We argue that these patterns reflect the heterogeneity and diversity of benthic habitats. A comparison of all OTUs against the Protist Ribosomal Reference database showed that a higher proportion of benthic than planktonic protist diversity is missing from public databases; similar results were obtained by comparing all OTUs against environmental references from NCBI’s Short Read Archive.

The hydrography in this region is dominated by a complex system of layered water masses, which includes the warm and oligotrophic Tropical Water (TW), the cold and nutrient rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and the Coastal Water (CW), which have highly variable properties. In order to assess how pico- and nanoplankton communities are distributed in these different water masses, we determined by flow cytometry the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria, Prochlorococcus , Synechococcus and autotrophic pico and nanoeukaryotes along three transects, extending from 23°S to 31°S and 39°W to 49°W. Heterotrophic bacteria (including archaea, maximum of 1.5 × 10 6 cells mL −1 ) were most abundant in Coastal and Tropical Water whereas Prochlorococcus was most abundant in open-ocean oligotrophic waters (maximum of 300 × 10 3 cells mL −1 ). Synechococcus (up to 81 × 10 3 cells mL −1 ), as well as autotrophic pico and nanoeukaryotes seemed to benefit from the influx of nutrient-rich waters near the continental slope. Autotrophic pico and nanoeukaryotes were also abundant in deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layers from offshore waters, and their highest abundances were 20 × 10 3 cells mL −1 and 5 × 10 3 cells mL −1 , respectively. These data are consistent with previous observations in other marine areas where Synechococcus and autotrophic eukaryotes dominate mesotrophic waters, whereas Prochlorococcus dominate in more oligotrophic areas. Regardless of the microbial community structure near the surface, the carbon stock dominance by autotrophic picoeukaryotes near the DCM is possibly linked to vertical mixing of oligotrophic surface waters with the nutrient-rich SACW and their tolerance to lower light levels.}, journal={PeerJ}, author={Gerikas Ribeiro, Catherine and Lopes dos Santos, Adriana and Marie, Dominique and Helena Pellizari, Vivian and Pereira Brandini, Frederico and Vaulot, Daniel}, year={2016}, month={Nov}, pages={e2587}}

The pigment composition of 14 strains representative of different subclades of clade VII was analyzed using a method that improves the separation of loroxanthin and neoxanthin. All the prasinophytes clade VII analyzed here showed a pigment composition similar to that previously reported for RCC287 corresponding to pigment group prasino-2A. However, we detected in addition astaxanthin for which it is the first report in prasinophytes. Among the strains analyzed, the pigment signature is qualitatively similar within subclades A and B. By contrast, RCC3402 from subclade C (Picocystis) lacks loroxanthin, astaxanthin, and antheraxanthin but contains alloxanthin, diatoxanthin, and monadoxanthin that are usually found in diatoms or cryptophytes. For subclades A and B, loroxanthin was lowest at highest light irradiance suggesting a light-harvesting role of this pigment in clade VII as in Tetraselmis.}, number={1}, journal={Journal of Phycology}, author={Lopes dos Santos, Adriana and Gourvil, Priscillia and Rodriguez-Hernandez, Francisco and Garrido, Jose Luis and Vaulot, Daniel}, year={2016}, pages={148–155}}

The ongo- ing environmental metabarcoding revolution opens the perspective for holistic ecosystems biological studies of these organisms, in particular the unicellular microalgae that often lack distinctive morphological characters and have complex life cycles. To interpret environmental sequences, metabarcoding necessarily relies on taxonomically curated databases containing reference sequences of the targeted gene (or barcode) from identified organisms. To date, no such reference framework exists for photosynthetic eukaryotes. In this study, we built the PhytoREF data- base that contains 6490 plastidial 16S rDNA reference sequences that originate from a large diversity of eukaryotes representing all known major photosynthetic lineages. We compiled 3333 amplicon sequences available from public databases and 879 sequences extracted from plastidial genomes, and generated 411 novel sequences from cultured marine microalgal strains belonging to different eukaryotic lineages. A total of 1867 environmental Sanger 16S rDNA sequences were also included in the database. Stringent quality filtering and a phylogeny-based taxonomic classifica- tion were applied for each 16S rDNA sequence. The database mainly focuses on marine microalgae, but sequences from land plants (representing half of the PhytoREF sequences) and freshwater taxa were also included to broaden the applicability of PhytoREF to different aquatic and terrestrial habitats.

We examined the effects of addition of the surfactant Pluronic F68 to glutaraldehyde-fixed photosynthetic organisms in cultures and natural samples. In particular, we examined cell losses and modifications of side scatter (a proxy of cell size) and fluorescence of natural pigments. We found that different marine phytoplankton species react differently to the action of Pluronic F68. In particular, photosynthetic prokaryotes are less sensitive than eukaryotes. Observed cell losses may result from cell lysis or from cell adhesion to the walls of plastic tubes that are commonly used for flow cytometry analysis. The addition of the surfactant, Pluronic F68, has a positive effect on cells for long-term storage. We recommend to modify current protocols for preservation of natural marine planktonic samples, by fixing them with glutaraldehyde 0.25% (final concentration) and adding Pluronic F68 at a final concentration of 0.01% in the samples before preservation. Pluronic F68 also appears effective for preserving samples without fixation for subsequent sorting, e.g. for molecular biology analyses.

The domestication of the CP gene was followed by an unprecedented recurrent replacement of the Rep genes in CHIVs with distant counterparts from diverse ssDNA viruses.

Picoplankton was dominated by Mamiellophyceae, a class of small green algae previously included in the prasinophytes: in the North East Pacific, the contribution of an Arctic Micromonas ecotype increased steadily northward becoming the only taxon occurring at most stations throughout the Beaufort Sea. In contrast, nanoplankton was more diverse: North Pacific stations were dominated by Pseudo-nitzschia sp. whereas those in the Beaufort Sea were dominated by two distinct Chaetoceros species as well as by Chrysophyceae, Pelagophyceae and Chrysochromulina spp.. This study confirms the importance of Arctic Micromonas within picoplankton throughout the Beaufort Sea and demonstrates that the photosynthetic picoeukaryote community in the Arctic is much less diverse than at lower latitudes.

The chloroplast was surrounded by four membranes possessing a nucleomorph in the periplastidial compartment near the pyrenoid base. According to ultrastructural observations of the pyrenoid and nucleomorph, the present species belongs to the genus Lotharella in the phylum Chlorarachniophyta. This taxonomic placement is consistent with the molecular phylogenetic trees of the 18S rRNA gene and ITS sequences. This species showed a unique colonization pattern. Clusters of cells extended cytoplasmic strands radially. Then, amoeboid cells being born proximately moved distally along the cytoplasmic strand like on a “railway track” Subsequently the amoeboid cell became coccoid near the strand. In this way, daughter cells were dispersed evenly on the substratum. We also observed that the present species regularly formed a structure of filopodial nodes in mid-stage and later-stage cultures, which is a novel phenotype in chlorarachniophytes. The unique colonization pattern and other unique features demonstrate that RCC375 is a new chlorarachniophyte belonging to genus Lotharella, which we describe as Lotharella reticulosa sp. nov. ?? 2011 Elsevier GmbH.}, number={1}, journal={Protist}, author={Ota, Shuhei and Vaulot, Daniel}, year={2012}, pages={91–104}}

Recently, a widely distributed planktonic uncultured nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium (UCYN-A) was found to have unprecedented genome reduction, including the lack of oxygen-evolving photosystem II and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which suggested partnership in a symbiosis. We showed that UCYN-A has a symbiotic association with a unicellular prymnesiophyte, closely related to calcifying taxa present in the fossil record. The partnership is mutualistic, because the prymnesiophyte receives fixed N in exchange for transferring fixed carbon to UCYN-A. This unusual partnership between a cyanobacterium and a unicellular alga is a model for symbiosis and is analogous to plastid and organismal evolution, and if calcifying, may have important implications for past and present oceanic N2 fixation.}, number={6101}, journal={Science}, author={Thompson, Anne W and Foster, Rachel A and Krupke, Andreas and Carter, Brandon J and Musat, Niculina and Vaulot, Daniel and Kuypers, Marcel M M and Zehr, Jonathan P}, year={2012}, pages={1546–1550}}

Traditionally, picoplankton refers to cells < or =2 microm. Here we extend the size range of the organisms considered to 3 microm, a threshold often used operationally in field studies. While the prokaryotic component of picophytoplankton is dominated by two genera, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, the eukaryotic fraction is much more diverse. Since the discovery of the ubiquitous Micromonas pusilla in the early 1950s, just over 70 species that can be <3 microm have been described. In fact, most algal classes contain such species. Less than a decade ago, culture-independent approaches (in particular, cloning and sequencing, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, FISH) have demonstrated that the diversity of eukaryotic picoplankton is much more extensive than could be assumed from described taxa alone. These approaches revealed the importance of certain classes such as the Prasinophyceae but also unearthed novel divisions such as the recently described picobiliphytes. In the last couple of years, the first genomes of photosynthetic picoplankton have become available, providing key information on their physiological capabilities.

Genetic libraries of the 18S rRNA gene were constructed using two different primer sets. The first set is commonly used to amplify the majority of eukaryotic lineages, while the second was composed of a general eukaryotic forward primer and a reverse primer biased towards the phylum Chloroplastida. A total of 3980 partial environmental sequences were obtained: 1668 using the general eukaryotic primer set and 2312 using the Chloroplastida-biased primer set. Of these sequences, 65 (4%) and 594 (26%) belonged to the Chloroplastida respectively. A 99.5% sequence similarity cut-off value allowed classification of these 659 Chloroplastida sequences into 74 different operational taxonomic units. A majority of the Chloroplastida sequences (99%) belonged to the prasinophytes. In addition to the seven independent prasinophyte lineages previously described, we discovered two new clades (clades VIII and IX), as well as a significant genetic diversity at the species and subspecies levels, notably among the genera Crustomastix, Dolichomastix and Mamiella (Mamiellales), but also within Pyramimonas and Halosphaera (Pyramimonadales). Such diversity within prasinophytes has not previously been observed by cloning approaches, illustrating the power of using targeted primers for clone library construction. Prasinophyte assemblages differed especially in relation to nutrient levels. Micromonas and Ostreococcus were mainly recovered from mesotrophic areas, whereas Mamiella, Crustomastix and Dolichomastix were mostly detected in oligotrophic surface waters. Within genera such as Ostreococcus or Crustomastix for which several clades were observed, depth seemed to be the main factor controlling differential distribution of genotypes.}, number={7}, journal={Environmental Microbiology}, author={Viprey, Manon and Guillou, Laure and Ferreol, Martial and Vaulot, Daniel}, year={2008}, pages={1804–1822}}

Six primer sets were designed targeting four different taxonomic levels: domain (Eukaryota), division (Chlorophyta), order (Mamiellales) and genus (Bathycoccus, Micromonas, and Ostreococcus). Reaction conditions were optimized for each primer set which was validated in silico, on agarose gels, and by QPCR against a variety of target and non-target cultures. The approach was tested by estimating gene copy numbers for Micromonas, Bathycoccus, and Ostreococcus in seawater samples to which cultured cells were added in various concentrations. QPCR was then used to determine that rRNA gene (rDNA) copy number varied from one to more than 12,000 in 18 strains of phytoplankton. Finally, QPCR was applied to environmental samples from a Mediterranean Sea coastal site and the results were compared to those obtained by Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The data obtained demonstrate that Chlorophyta and more specifically Mamiellales were important in these waters, especially during the winter picoplankton bloom. The timing of major abundance peaks of the targeted species was similar by QPCR and FISH. When used in conjunction with other techniques such as FISH or gene clone libraries, QPCR appears as very promising to quickly obtain data on the ecological distribution of important phytoplankton groups.

This revealed a large genetic diversity within the marine Synechococcus cluster consistent with earlier work but also identified three novel clades not previously recognized. Phylogenetic analyses showed one clade, containing halotolerant isolates lacking phycoerythrin (PE) and including strains capable, or not, of utilizing nitrate as the sole N source, which clustered within the MC-A (Synechococcus subcluster 5.1) lineage. Two copies of the 16S rRNA gene are present in marine Synechococcus genomes, and cloning and sequencing of these copies from Synechococcus sp. strain WH 7803 and genomic information from Synechococcus sp. strain WH 8102 reveal these to be identical. Based on the 16S rDNA sequence information, clade-specific oligonucleotides for the marine Synechococcus genus were designed and their specificity was optimized. Using dot blot hybridization technology, these probes were used to determine the in situ community structure of marine Synechococcus populations in the Red Sea at the time of a Synechococcus maximum during April 1999. A predominance of genotypes representative of a single clade was found, and these genotypes were common among strains isolated into culture. Conversely, strains lacking PE, which were also relatively easily isolated into culture, represented only a minor component of the Synechococcus population. Genotypes corresponding to well-studied laboratory strains also appeared to be poorly represented in this stratified water column in the Red Sea.}, number={5}, journal={Applied and Environmental Microbiology}, author={Fuller, Nicholas J and Marie, Dominique and Partensky, Frederic and Vaulot, Daniel and Post, Anton F and Scanlan, David J}, year={2003}, pages={2430–2443}} 

@article{Mary_2003, title={Two-component systems in Prochlorococcus MED4: Genomic analysis and differential expression under stress}, volume={226}, abstractNote={Two-component signal transduction systems, composed of histidine sensory kinases and response regulators, constitute a key element of the mechanism by which bacteria sense and acclimatize to changes in their environment. The availability of whole genome sequences permits a detailed analysis of these genes in cyanobacteria. In the present paper, we focus mainly on Prochlorococcus MED4, a strain adapted to surface oceanic conditions, for which six putative response regulators (rer) and five putative histidine kinases (hik) were identified. These numbers are comparable to those found in the other marine picocyanobacteria but much lower than those found in freshwater cyanobacteria. Moreover, the diversity of these genes is low in Prochlorococcus since most histidine kinases are related to a single group (type I) and most response regulators to a single family (OmpR). Under standard conditions, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that one hik (hik03) and two rer (rer04 and rer05) genes were expressed at relatively high levels compared to the other two-component system genes. In response to high light exposure, a moderate increase (>5-fold) was observed in the expression of some putative rer genes (rer01, rer04, rer05, and rer06), whereas a smaller increase (<3-fold) in hik03 and hik04 mRNA levels was detected. In contrast, both cold and heat shocks decreased rather than increased the expression of most hik and rer genes. ?? 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Recently, a family of genes designated hli was demonstrated to be important for survival of cyanobacteria during exposure to high light. In this study we have identified members of the hli gene family in seven cyanobacterial genomes, including those of a marine cyanobacterium adapted to high-light growth in surface waters of the open ocean (Prochlorococcus sp. strain Med4), three marine cyanobacteria adapted to growth in moderate- or low-light (Prochlorococcus sp. strain MIT9313, Prochlorococcus marinus SS120, and Synechococcus WH8102), and three freshwater strains (the unicellular Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 and the filamentous species Nostoc punctiforme strain ATCC29133 and Anabaena sp. {Nostoc} strain PCC7120). The high-light-adapted Prochlorococcus Med4 has the smallest genome (1.7 Mb), yet it has more than twice as many hli genes as any of the other six cyanobacterial species, some of which appear to have arisen from recent duplication events. Based on cluster analysis, some groups of hli genes appear to be specific to either marine or freshwater cyanobacteria. This information is discussed with respect to the role of hli genes in the acclimation of cyanobacteria to high light, and the possible relationships among members of this diverse gene family.

Such association has recently been hypothesized to be involved in the toxicity of the dinoflagellate genus Al-exandrium. However, the methods, which have been used so far to identify, localize, and quantify bacteria associated with phytoplankton, are either destructive, time consuming, or lack precision. In the present study we combined tyramide signal amplification-fluorescent in situ. hybridization (TSA-FISH) with confocal microscopy to determine the physical association of dinoflagellate cells with bacteria. Dinoflagellate attached microflora was successfully identified with TSA-FISH, whereas FISH using monolabeled probes failed to detect bacteria, because of the dinoflagellate autofluorescence. Bacteria attached to entire dinoflagellates were further localized and distinguished from those attached to empty theca, by using calcofluor and DAPI, two fluorochromes that stain dinoflagellate theca and DNA, respectively. The contribution of specific bacterial taxa of attached microflora was assessed by double hybridization. Endocytoplasmic and endonuclear bacteria were successfully identified in the nonthecate dinoflagellate Gyrodinium instriatum. In contrast, intracellular bacteria were not observed in either toxic or nontoxic strains of Alexandrium spp. Finally, the method was successfully tested on natural phytoplankton assemblages, suggesting that this combination of techniques could prove a useful tool for the simultaneous identification, localization, and quantification of bacteria physically associated with dinoflagellates and more generally with phytoplankton.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Phycology}, author={Biegala, I C and Kennaway, G and Alverca, E and Lennon, J F and Vaulot, D and Simon, N}, year={2002}, pages={404–411}}

Intensive sampling was performed in order to assess the short time-scale variability of the microbial community. Five autotrophic groups (including Synechococcus spp, and cryptophytes), 2 groups of heterotrophic bacteria, and 2 groups of viruses could be discriminated by FCM. The control enclosure (no addition) revealed that heterotrophic bacteria were carbon-limited. Synechococcus spp. abundance increased in the control, presumably because they experienced little competition from heterotrophic bacteria (which were C-limited) and from larger phytoplankton (which were not as efficient in nutrient uptake at low nutrient concentration and could not, therefore, sustain high growth rates). When N and P were added, however, larger-celled autotrophic populations were favoured. When glucose was added, alone or together with inorganic elements, the abundance of Synechococcus spp. and small eukaryotes was reduced, suggesting that, when released from C-limitation, heterotrophic bacteria are the best competitors for mineral nutrients. The addition of both inorganic and organic nutrients also enhanced cryptophytes in contrast to all other autotrophs, probably because of their heterotrophic capacity. Our results agree with recent evidence suggesting that heterotrophic bacteria are limited by both carbon and mineral nutrients, and demonstrate how this has important consequences for the success of their trophic neighbours in the microbial food web.}, journal={Marine Ecology Progress Series}, author={Jacquet, S and Havskum, H and Thingstad, T F and Vaulot, D}, year={2002}, pages={3–14}}

During the Almofront-2 cruise (November 22, 1997 to January 18, 1998), high frequency sampling (Deltat = 0.5 h) of autotrophic picoplankton in surface waters was performed for 17 days (December 24 to January 9) using an automatic sampler. Cell abundance and several cellular parameters were measured by flow cytometry (FCM): forward and right-angle light scatters (FALS, RALS), phycoerythrin (PE) and chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence. Analysis of abundance of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes allowed the distinction of two major types of systems: mesotrophic conditions (with waters characterized by detectable nutrients) dominated by picoeukaryotes and more oligotrophic areas (with low to undetectable nutrient levels) dominated by Prochlorococcus and, to a lower extent, Synechococcus. Most of the cellular parameters exhibited a clear diel periodicity, suggesting that cell growth and division processes were tightly coupled to the daily light cycle despite strong gradients of temperature and salinity. Cell growth for both Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes began at dawn and stopped at dusk. In contrast, the increase of Prochlorococcus light scattering only began in late afternoon, a very unusual behaviour that was apparently associated with strong quenching of Prochlorococcus Chl fluorescence during the day. Our data also suggested Chl quenching in Synechococcus but not in picoeukaryotes. Fourier analysis established unambiguously the 24 h diel periodicity for all cellular parameters as well as for cryptophyte abundance, but not for the abundance of other phytoplankters. The burst of division for picophytoplanktonic cells, inferred from the timing of the decrease of light scatter, occurred at dusk for both Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes, and later at night for Prochlorococcus. The ratio between maximum and minimum scatter (RALS(max/min)) was useful in assessing the physiological state of the different picoplankters: high values suggested that populations probably had high division rates, especially picoeukaryotes, suggesting a quasi-optimal physiological activity of the cells in all water types encountered during this cruise despite strong hydrological gradients.

Target cells were detected and enumerated using epifluorescence microscopy. The sensitivity of the technique and the specificity of the probes were tested on pure and mixed picoplanktonic strains, as well as on natural samples from the English Channel.

The attachment behavior of both bacterial strains was monitored using TSA-FISH (tyramide signal amplification and fluorescent in situ hybridization) and confocal microscopy. Our results suggest that ageing dinoflagellate cultures stimulate both free bacterial growth and attachment.

S. scintillans does not feed on the 2 cyanobacteria. In contrast, P. flagellatus appears as an active predator capable of drastically reducing prey concentrations. The flagellate displays a substantial division rate of the order of 2 doublings d(-1) when fed on Prochlorococcus cells, but no significant growth is recorded when Synechococcus is used as prey. As the majority (> 80%) of P. flagellatus cells can pass throughout a 2 mum filter, the impact of such tiny predators should be taken into consideration during field experiments that rely on size fractionation to separate grazers from prey.}, number={2}, journal={Aquatic Microbial Ecology}, author={Guillou, L and Jacquet, S and Chretiennot-Dinet, M.-J. and Vaulot, D}, year={2001}, pages={201–207}}

These included the photosynthetic prokaryotes Pro-chlorococcus (strains MED 4, PCC 9511, and SS 120) and Synechococcus (strains ALMO 03, ROS 04, WH 7803, and WH 8103) and five picoeukaryotes (Bathycoccus prasinos Eikrem et Throndsen, Bolidomonas pacifica Guillou et Chretiennot-Dinet, Micromonas pusilla Manton et Parke, Pelagomonas calceolata Andersen et Saunders, and Pycnococcus provasolii Guillard et al.). Flow cytometric analysis was used to determine the relationship between cell light scatter, pigment fluorescence, DNA (when possible), and the LD cycle in these organisms. Asexpected, growth and division were tightly coupled to the LD cycle for all of these strains. For both Prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes, chi and intracellular carbon increased throughout the light period as estimated by chi fluorescence and light scatter, respectively. In response to cell division, these parameters decreased regularly during the early part of the dark period, a decrease that either continued throughout the dark period or stopped for the second half of the dark period. For Synechococcus, the decrease of chi and scatter occurred earlier (in the middle of the light period), and for some strains these cellular parameters remained constant throughout the dark period. The timing of division was very similar for all picoeukaryotes and occurred just before the subjective dusk, whereas it was more variable between the different Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus strains. The burst of division for Prochlorococcus SS 120 and PCC 9511 was recorded at the subjective dusk, whereas the MED 4 strain divided later at night. Synechococcus ALMO 03, ROS 04, and WH 7803, which have a low phycourobilin to phycoerythrobilin (PUB:PEB) ratio, divided earlier, and their division was restricted to the light period.

@article{Jacq_2001, title={Cell cycle regulation by light in Prochlorococcus strains}, volume={67}, abstractNote={The effect of light on the synchronization of cell cycling was investigated in several strains of the oceanic photosynthetic prokaryote Prochlorococcus using flow cytometry. When exposed to a light-dark (L-D) cycle with an irradiance of 25 mu mol of quanta m(-2) s(-1), the low-light-adapted strain SS 120 appeared to be better synchronized than the high-light-adapted strain PCC 9511. Submitting LD-entrained populations to shifts (advances or delays) in the timing of the “light on” signal translated to corresponding shifts in the initiation of the S phase, suggesting that this signal is a key parameter for the synchronization of population cell cycles. Cultures that were shifted from an L-D cycle to continuous irradiance showed persistent diel oscillations of flow-cytometric signals (light scatter and chlorophyll fluorescence) but with significantly reduced amplitudes and a phase shift. Complete darkness arrested most of the cells in the G(1), phase of the cell cycle, indicating that light is required to trigger the initiation of DNA replication and cell division. However, some cells also arrested in the S phase, suggesting that cell cycle controls in Prochlorococcus spp. are not as strict as in marine Synechococcus spp. Shifting Prochlorococcus cells from low to high irradiance translated quasi-instantaneously into an increase of cells in both the S and G(2) phases of the cell cycle and then into faster growth, whereas the inverse shift induced rapid slowing of the population growth rate.

In order to study the time scale of variations in light absorption induced by photoacclimation, 2 strains (MED, clone CCMP 1378, and SARG, unialgal strain) were grown in batch cultures at high (56.7 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) or low (8.4 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) irradiance. Then the temporal changes over 3 to 4 d in spectral absorption coefficients, pigment composition, cell number density and size distribution were followed for cultures transferred from high to low irradiance, and vice versa. Both strains experienced significant changes in their divinyl-chlorophyll a-specific absorption coefficients (a*) in response to the transfers. For the MED strain, photoacclimation appeared to be achieved within about 40 h (covering 2 cell generations) for the low to high irradiance transfer, while 3 to 4 d (corresponding to 1 doubling of the population) were necessary for the high to low irradiance transfer. For the SARG strain transferred from high to low irradiance, in spite of a rapid change in absorption during the first 25 h (i.e. Within the same cell generation), full photoacclimation was not achieved after 3 d. The efficiency factors for absorption, <(Q(a))over bar>(lambda), and the a*(lambda) coefficients, were reconstructed from theory at the different photoacclimation stages from the cell characteristics, i.e. Intracellular concentrations of the various pigments and cell size distribution. This permitted the determination of the parameters which are mainly responsible for the observed changes. The <(Q(a))over bar>(lambda) values (and therefore the package effect) are enhanced at low irradiance by 2 effects resulting from photoacclimation: the increase of the intracellular concentration of divinyl-chlorophyll a, and (for the SARG strain only) the increase of the intracellular concentration of chlorophyll b. In addition, the presence of zeaxanthin, in stable amounts within the cells whatever the irradiance, enhances the <(Q(a))over bar>(lambda) values for all light conditions, and thus “moderates” its variations with irradiance.

For example, Synechococcus is restricted to the first 100 m, whereas Prochlorococcus extends much deeper in oligotrophic waters. This is in part explained by differences in adaptation to nutrient and light regimes. However, they could also be subjected to different predation rates. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the consumption of these two picoplankters by an algivorous ciliate, Strombidium sulcatum, and a bactivorous ciliate. Uronema sp. For both ciliate species, removal rates were higher by a factor of 3 to 10, for Synechococcus compared to Prochlorococcus when prey items were presented alone or together. The growth of the two ciliates fed Synechococcus and/or Prochlorococcus also differed. S. Sulcatum grew well on both prey items, whether alone or together, whereas Uronema sp. Grew slowly when fed Synechococcus and very poorly when fed Prochlorococcus either alone or with Synechococcus.

Eight strains of Bolidophyceae were isolated in culture from different mesotrophic and oligotrophic areas. The corresponding small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequences allowed us to design two probes specific for the Bolidophyceae. These probes have been used in natural samples (i) to selectively amplify and detect Bolidophyceae sequences and (ii) to quantify the relative abundance of Bolidophyceae within the picoeukaryote community. Sequences available to date indicate that the class Bolidophyceae comprises at least three different clades, two corresponding to the previously described species Bolidomonas pacifica and Bolidomonas mediterranea and the third one corresponding to a subspecies of B. Pacifica. Amplification of the SSU rRNA gene from natural samples with universal primers and hybridization using a Bolidomonas-specific probe followed by a eukaryote-specific probe allowed us to estimate the contribution of the Bolidophyceae to the eukaryotic DNA in both Pacific and Mediterranean waters to be lower than 1%. Similarly, high-performance liquid chromatography analyses of fucoxanthin, the major carotenoid present in Bolidophyceae, indicated that less than 4% of the total chlorophyll a in the picoplanktonic fraction in the equatorial Pacific was due to Bolidophyceae.

@article{Part_1999, title={Prochlorococcus, a marine photosynthetic prokaryote of global significance.}, volume={63}, abstractNote={The minute photosynthetic prokaryote Prochlorococcus, which was discovered about 10 years ago, has proven exceptional from several standpoints. Its tiny size (0.5 to 0.7 microm in diameter) makes it the smallest known photosynthetic organism. Its ubiquity within the 40 degrees S to 40 degrees N latitudinal band of oceans and its occurrence at high density from the surface down to depths of 200 m make it presumably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth. Prochlorococcus typically divides once a day in the subsurface layer of oligotrophic areas, where it dominates the photosynthetic biomass. It also possesses a remarkable pigment complement which includes divinyl derivatives of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and Chl b, the so-called Chl a2 and Chl b2, and, in some strains, small amounts of a new type of phycoerythrin. Phylogenetically, Prochlorococcus has also proven fascinating. Recent studies suggest that it evolved from an ancestral cyanobacterium by reducing its cell and genome sizes and by recruiting a protein originally synthesized under conditions of iron depletion to build a reduced antenna system as a replacement for large phycobilisomes. Environmental constraints clearly played a predominant role in Prochlorococcus evolution. Its tiny size is an advantage for its adaptation to nutrient-deprived environments. Furthermore, genetically distinct ecotypes, with different antenna systems and ecophysiological characteristics, are present at depth and in surface waters. This vertical species variation has allowed Prochlorococcus to adapt to the natural light gradient occurring in the upper layer of oceans.

The evolution of abundance and cell parameters were monitored once per hour by flow cytometry for these populations: Synechococcus cyanobacteria, photosynthetic picoeukaryotes, and heterotrophic bacteria plus Prochlorococcus. Some parameters, such as the right-angle light scatter of Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes, or the red chlorophyll fluorescence of picoeukaryotes, exhibited a very clear 24-h diel periodicity. For other parameters, such as Synechococcus red chlorophyll fluorescence, it was necessary to perform a Fourier analysis to establish a major 24-h period unambiguously. This analysis also revealed that some other parameters, however, such as the cell concentration, right-angle light scatter, and red chlorophyll fluorescence of picoeukaryotes, or the red chlorophyll and orange phycoerythrin fluorescence of Synechococcus, had a period of 17-18 h, corresponding to the inertial frequency at this latitude. The cell cycle of Synechococcus, sampled twice per hour, was synchronized with the daily light cycle, allowing an estimate of their growth rate, which averaged 0.95 d(-1) (SD = 0.26, n = 7). Its large day-to-day variability was related to the duration of the interval between the maxima of S and G2 phases that ranged from 2 to 3.5 hours. Generally, the division rate was depressed on sunny days. The loss rate of Synechococcus was in general lower than the division rate and appeared to follow the evolution of the latter with a 1-d lag, as if grazers or viruses adapted very rapidly to changes in division rates. Over the period of study, concentrations of Synechococcus and other bacteria were significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.60, p < 0.01, n = 340), suggesting the possibility of a common controlling factor for these populations, e.g., phosphorus or grazing.}, number={8}, journal={Limnology and Oceanography}, author={Jacquet, S and Lennon, J F and Marie, D and Vaulot, D}, year={1998}, pages={1916–1931}}

@article{Yahe_1998, title={Phytoplankton distribution and grazing near coral reefs}, volume={43}, abstractNote={Depletion of phytoplankton cells and pigments over coral reefs was studied in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, during 1994-1996. Phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll (Chl) a concentrations were 15-65% lower near the reefs than in the adjacent open waters. The decrease in chlorophyll. Near the reef was typically associated with an increase in the concentration of its degradation products, the pheopigments. The steepest slope of these cross-shore gradients occurred within 1-3 m above bottom. More than 50% of the variation in the extent of the chlorophyll gradients, but not of pheopigments, could be explained by the advection of water during 2 h preceding the transect and by the concentration of Chl a in the open water. No cross-shore gradients were observed at a sandy-bottom site without reef. Eukaryotic phytoplankton (<5 mu m) contributed >70% of; the total depleted carbon near the reef during winter, while the cyanobacterium Synechococcus (1 mu m) contributed the largest share in summer. The proportions of different taxa in depleted fractions were similar to those in ambient waters, indicating no size selectivity. Direct measurements of phytoplankton removal rates were made in water passing through a unique 5-m-long perforated reef, dominated by herbivorous soft corals. The waters downstream of that reef were strongly depleted of phytoplankton (10 to >36%, or 32 to >100 ng Chl a liter(-1)). When converted to carbon fluxes, these rates greatly exceeded reported values of carbon input to coral reefs via zooplankton predation.

A significant seasonal cycle was evident in cellular chlorophyll fluorescence for each of the autotrophic components, with maxima occurring each winter as a consequence of photoacclimation. Abundance of each picophytoplankton component exhibited temporal variability on both seasonal and interannual scales. Although the magnitude gf the seasonal cycles in the abundance was relatively small, the cycles appeared to be out of Phase. Typically, abundance maxima of Synechococcus occurred in winter, of picoeucaryotes in spring, and of Prochlorococcus during summer/fall. The different timing in these cycles may explain why the presence of a seasonal pattern in total phytoplankton biomass has been difficult to establish. Abundance of the larger 3-20 mu m algae varied over two orders of magnitude during the time series, with no obvious seasonal pattern. The 3-20 mu m algae were a small percentage of the total estimated carbon biomass (similar to 8%). Heterotrophic bacteria were the most numerous of the picoplankton, and the seasonal pattern in their 200-m integrated abundance paralleled Prochlorococcus over the time series. Together, the procaryotes contributed 60-90% of the total estimated microbial carbon. Significant interannual variation in the total 200-m integrated microbial carbon estimates may be related to the effects of the extended ENSO event, which began in 1991.

They were termed authentic and alternate cells and differed with respect to scale morphology. To investigate whether or not the two cell forms were joined in a sexual life cycle, the relative DNA content per cell and relative size of cells of several clonal cultures of C. polylepis were determined by flow cytometry. Percentages of authentic and alternate cells in the cultures were estimated by transmission electron microscopy. Pure authentic cultures (a) contained cells with the lowest level of DNA and were termed haploid. Two pure alternate cultures (b) contained cells with double the DNA content of authentic cells and were termed diploid. Other pure alternate cultures contained haploid cells only, or both haploid and diploid cells. Three cell types were observed, each capable of vegetative propagation: authentic haploid, alternate haploid, and alternate diploid cells. Both the haploid and diploid alternate cells were larger than the haploid authentic cells. Cultures containing diploid cells appeared unstable: cell type ratio and ploidy ratio changed during the experiment where this cell type was present, particularly when grown in continuous light. In contrast, cultures with only haploid cells remained unchanged at all growth conditions tested. Light condition may influence cell type ratio and ploidy ratio. Our attempt to induce syngamy by mixing different authentic haploid clones did not result in mating. Assuming that the authentic and alternate cell types are of the same species, the life cycle of C. polylepis includes three flagellated scale-covered cell forms.

Three cell populations were discriminated by flow cytometry: Prochlorococcus prochlorophytes, Synechococcus cyanobacteria, and picoeukaryotes. Prochlorococcus were the most abundant component (maximum ca 2 × 105 cells ml−1). Unlike previous reports, their concentration was almost constant down to roughly 100 m, with a slight maximum at the surface or near the chlorophyll maximum. Cellular chlorophyll fluorescence increased 50-fold between surface and deep populations. One distinguishing feature of the community off Hawaii was the co-occurrence near the chlorophyll maximum of at least two distinct Prochlorococcus populations with different chlorophyll and DNA contents. Throughout the year, Synechococcus abundance was two orders of magnitude lower and there was no seasonal alteration between Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, as observed in the northern Sargasso Sea. Synechococcus populations did not extend below 120 m and were dominated by high phycourobilin cell types. Picoeukaryote abundance was quite similar to that of Synechococcus, but these cells extended deeper in the water column. Their chlorophyll fluorescence exhibited much less depth variation than Prochlorococcus or Synechococcus. Seasonal variability was small (<2- to 3-fold) for all three components of the picoplankton, not only for cell abundance but also for cellular parameters such as light scatter or pigment fluorescence. Synechococcus populations exhibited the largest seasonal changes (e.g. abundance maximum and chlorophyll fluorescence varied 3-fold). Picoplankton community structure in the Pacific Ocean appears to be distinct from previous reports for other areas. In comparing station ALOHA to the Atlantic Ocean (especially the Sargasso Sea) and the Mediterranean Sea, depth-integrated abundances of Prochlorococcus were higher, that of Synechococcus were lower, and that of picoeukaryotes were similar. We believe this structure, dominated by Prochlorococcus, may be typical for subtropical open-ocean regions.}, number={10}, journal={Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers}, author={Campbell, Lisa and Vaulot, Daniel}, year={1993}, pages={2043–2060}}

A lower bound for the daily division rate of a phased cell population can be computed as ln[(1 + f(max))/(1 + f(min))] where f(max) and f(min) are the maximal and minimal fractions of cells in a terminal phase of the cell cycle (e.g. mitosis) over a light: dark cycle. This new formula extends the previous analysis of McDuff and Chisholm to the case of slow-growing cells that spend more than 1 d in the terminal phase. It should be useful in the case of phytoplankton populations growing in oligotrophic waters. Further, the error between this lower bound and the actual value of the division rate is expressed as a function of the durations of the terminal phase and of the division burst.}, number={3}, journal={Limnology and Oceanography}, author={Vaulot, Daniel}, year={1992}, pages={644–649}}

Each cell type was able to divide and had its own growth dynamics; therefore, any intermediary between pure populations of “small” and of “large” cells were observed in culture. The “large” form generated a “small” cell by an atypical budding-like division, whereas the “small” form gave back a “large” form, once it ceased to divide, by simple enlargement of its cell body. Factory inducing cell size differentiation are yet unclear. Neither nitrogen nor phosphorus starvation induced a significant increase in the relative proportion of “small” and budding cells. Although cell size differentiation is associated with the formation of gametes in a variety of dinoflagellates, we demonstrated that “small” cells of G. cf. nagasakiense are able to divide asexually, in contrast to gametes of most other species. The high proliferative power of “small” cells as compared with normal cells suggests that they could play a significant role during red tides of G. cf. nagasakiense; in contrast, cells of the Japanese species G. Nagasakiense could sustain high growth rates with larger cell size because this species generally blooms in waters much warmer than those found in northern Europe.}, number={4}, journal={Journal of Phycology}, publisher={Blackwell Science Inc}, author={Partensky, Frederic and Vaulot, Daniel}, year={1989}, pages={741–750}}

@article{Vaul_1987, title={A simple model of the growth of phytoplankton populations in light/dark cycles}, volume={9}, abstractNote={Phytoplankton populations have been shown to be entrained by alternating periods of light and darkness in natural waters as well as in laboratory cultures. A simple model for the growth of such populations, as reflected by cell division, is presented here. The model takes as its structural unit the single cell, using Spudich and Sager’s transition point hypothesis for the coupling between received light and cell cycle progression. A stochastic component is also included to account for cell-to-cell variability. The model predicts that the characteristics of cell division patterns in populations entrained by photocycles depends mainly on the position of the transition point within the cell cycle, rather than on the characteristics of the photocyclic regime. The model simulates successfully the major features of observed division patterns of several phytoplankton species. In addition, the model can be used to predict division patterns in high frequency photocycles and during transients induced by shifts in light regime. Under these conditions, the simulated patterns are also consistent with the hypothesis of a circadian clock controlled cell cycle, except in the case of free running transients.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Plankton Research}, author={Vaulot, Daniel and Chisholm, Sallie W.}, year={1987}, pages={345–366}}
